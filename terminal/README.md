# Terminal
Terminal interface is the whole app interface, a CLI is just one command at a time.

## Operating Systems
Mac is not suited very well to learn the terminal, as it does not have a linux bash installed. Mac OS itself is a BSD-based operating system (Darwin) and therefore has it differences from a linux terminal.

## Important tips
Do NOT use Ctrl + L to clear the screen, use the `clear` command! The shortcut is not available on all systems, only on those w/ emacs mapping.

Remember to use tab/double tab completion!
