## Copyright
All software is subject to copyright law. Copyright prevents unpermitted non-copyright holders from modifying, distributing and copying a work of software. Only the copyright holder has the right to do so.  
The permission to execute the stated rights is called a license, which the copyright holder can grant.  
The scope of a license can vary depending on the will of the copyright holder.  
Distributing or copying, etc without a license can allow the copyright holder to sue the person doing it for damages or ask a court to order you not to make or distribute further copies (Schadenersatz und Unterlassungserkl√§rung).

## Copyleft
Copyleft is the concept of applying copyright to ensure the permission denied by copyright law are *explicitly allowed* on copyleft licensed software.  
Copyleft licenses are conditional licenses in the sense that they demand the user of such licensed software to make sure the changes made to the software are likewise released under the copylefted license.  
The goal here is to ensure software licensed with copyleft can be built upon and assembled not break copyright law. The concept it stems from is "giving back".
